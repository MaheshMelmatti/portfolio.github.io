### Hello, I'm Mahesh Melmatti 👋

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## 🛠 Projects
- *Project 1*: Route Optimisation
- 
A Route Management System (RMS) in Design Analysis and Algorithm is a framework used to plan, optimize, and analyze routes in a network, such as transportation, logistics, or communication systems. It involves:

Design: Representing the problem as a graph, where nodes are locations and edges are paths with costs like distance or time.
Algorithms: Applying efficient algorithms like Dijkstra’s, A*, or Bellman-Ford for shortest paths, or optimization techniques for multi-constraint problems.
Analysis: Evaluating performance based on time complexity, space complexity, and system constraints.

## 🚀 Skills
- C++, Python, JavaScript
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Web Development (React.js, Node.js)
