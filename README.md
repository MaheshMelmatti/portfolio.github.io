### Hello, I'm Mahesh Melmatti üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ† Projects
- *Project 1*: Route Optimisation
- 
A Route Management System (RMS) in Design Analysis and Algorithm is a framework used to plan, optimize, and analyze routes in a network, such as transportation, logistics, or communication systems. It involves:

Design: Representing the problem as a graph, where nodes are locations and edges are paths with costs like distance or time.
Algorithms: Applying efficient algorithms like Dijkstra‚Äôs, A*, or Bellman-Ford for shortest paths, or optimization techniques for multi-constraint problems.
Analysis: Evaluating performance based on time complexity, space complexity, and system constraints.

- *Project 2*: Selling Recycled products
- 
Selling Recycled Products in Design, Analysis, and Algorithm involves developing a computational framework to optimize the production, pricing, and distribution of recycled goods to maximize profits while minimizing environmental impact.

Design: Models the system by incorporating supply chains, production costs, and consumer demand. It involves identifying key components like raw material availability, processing facilities, and target markets.

Algorithm: Utilizes optimization techniques such as linear programming, greedy algorithms, or machine learning to determine optimal pricing strategies, inventory management, and distribution routes. Algorithms can also predict demand and identify cost-effective recycling processes.

Analysis: Evaluates the system's performance by analyzing cost-efficiency, environmental benefits, and market reach. Factors like time complexity of algorithms and adaptability to varying demand patterns are assessed.
